# SQL-Airline-Database-Project
A project to design and implement a relational database for an airline ticket reservation system using SQL, including schema design, ER diagram, and query implementation. 


**Airline Ticket Reservation Database**

**üìñ Overview**

An efficient and well-structured ticket reservation system is critical to the success of any airline. This project addresses this need by designing and implementing a comprehensive relational database for a fictional airline, "Eagle Airlines." The database is built to handle all key aspects of the flight booking process, from managing flight and aircraft details to processing passenger bookings and ticket information, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. 


**‚ú® Key Features**

**- Normalized Schema:** The database is designed with normalized tables (First Normal Form) to ensure data atomicity and reduce redundancy. 

**- Relational Integrity:** Utilizes Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK) to maintain strong relationships and data consistency between tables. 

**- Comprehensive Design:** The schema covers 7 core entities essential to airline operations: Aircraft, Flights, Seats, Airports, Tickets, Passengers, and Bookings. 



**üèõÔ∏è Database Schema**

The database consists of 7 primary tables designed to manage the airline's operations efficiently. 

**1. Aircraft (Pesawat):** Stores details about each aircraft, including model and flight range. 

**2. Flights (Penerbangan):** Contains information for each flight, such as departure/arrival schedules, airports, and flight status. 

**3. Seats (Kursi_Pesawat):** Manages seat details for each aircraft, including seat number and class. 

**4. Airports (Bandara):** Holds information about all airports, including name, city, and coordinates. 

**5. Tickets (Tiket_Penerbangan):** Links a passenger to a specific flight and seat, and includes the ticket price. 

**6. Passengers (Penumpang):** Stores personal data for passengers who make bookings. 

**7. Bookings (Pemesanan):** Records booking details, including booking date and total price. 


**üó∫Ô∏è Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**

The following ER Diagram illustrates the relationships between all entities in the database.

**‚öôÔ∏è Example SQL Queries**

### Example SQL Queries
The database supports various analytical queries to derive business insights. Here are a few examples:

#### 1. Calculate Total Revenue per Aircraft Model
This query calculates the total ticket revenue generated by each aircraft model. 
```sql
SELECT
  model_pesawat,
  SUM(harga_tiket) AS total_pendapatan
FROM
  data_sql
GROUP BY
  model_pesawat;
```

**2. Find the Average Ticket Price per Seat Class**

This query determines the average ticket price for each class (e.g., Business, Economy). 

```sql
SELECT
  kelas_kursi,
  AVG(harga_tiket) AS rata_rata_harga
FROM
  data_sql
GROUP BY
  kelas_kursi;
```

**3. Count the Number of Passengers per Aircraft**

This query counts the total number of passengers that have flown on each aircraft. 

```sql

SELECT
  id_pesawat,
  COUNT(id_penumpang) AS jumlah_penumpang
FROM
  data_sql
GROUP BY
  id_pesawat;

```

  
**üñ•Ô∏è GUI Concept**

A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) was also designed in Google Colab to facilitate easy interaction with the database for booking tickets and checking flight information.
